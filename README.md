This project focuses on improving ABC's marketing strategy by analyzing limited available data on conversion rates, 
customer engagement, and customer feedback. Using PowerBI for visualization, SQL for querying campaign and performance data, 
and Python for sentiment analysis, the analysis highlights key trends and suggests actionable insights to optimize marketing efforts 
and customer satisfaction. The findings are based on available data, 
such as campaign metrics and customer reviews, with a focus on addressing low engagement, conversion drop-offs, and feedback scores.
